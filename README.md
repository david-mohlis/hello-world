# hello-world
Just another repository

I am just getting started with GitHub and want to learn more about it. 
I just finished my computer science degree, but have no projects to my name other than school projects. 
I will be working on smaller personal projects while looking for developer opportunities.
I have mainly written in HTML/CSS, C#/XAML, and Java.
